        <h1>Empowering Community ALS Implementers Through Digital Citizenship</h1>
        <p> 

                Technology plays a big role in our lives nowadays.it may have advantage and disadvantage but usually it is a big help for us. It has a big impact for business owners,
            making their transaction smooth, meeting can be held through Video call. Our government, in storing files, now they can save the files in computer and reduce consumption 
            on papers, it is also efficient incase of Fire they can retrieve data though the PC even if Hard copies are damaged. In security purpose, we now have CCTV’s which one can 
            control even if you are far from your place, establishment and etc. you can still monitor what is happening as you can check what’s happening through CCTV. Technology is 
            important for teacher’s as it helps teachers in recording and computing for learners grades easier through Microsoft Excel, for Instructional Materials, teachers can create 
            a presentation in Microsoft PowerPoint which is cost efficient for teachers and time saver. Technology is also a big helping hand for learners especially during the time of 
            Pandemic, they continue learning through Online classes and watching in some platforms created for learning. Today’s generation is more on Technology, as a teacher we 
            need to learn new trends for our learners to listen to us we have to integrate new trends, new strategies and methods to our teaching practice.

                Alternative Learning System together with NBSC Research Extension has launched a program about Empowering ALS Implementers through Digital Citizenship where they will Introduce 
            Technology for teaching to ALS Implementers or CAIs, and I am of on those CAIs who participated in the said program. During our first day I gained a lot of knowledge especially in 
            checking for the specs of a PC or laptop when you purchase, I learned about the parts of the computers the hardware and software, our instructor also shared some troubleshooting tips 
            which helps me in understanding more about computers and laptops. The next day I gained an understanding of Spreadsheet, Ma’am Phoebe taught us some keyboard shortcuts, ways in opening, 
            switching, and saving a spreadsheet, how to format a column or a cell. She discussed the parts of the spreadsheets, how to use Autofill, modify rows and columns, merge them, and lastly 
            how to add a chart in the spreadsheet. Last topic for Microsoft Excel is about applying arithmetic formula which will be a big help for me someday especially in computing for learner’s grades. 
            Next topic is on Microsoft PowerPoint we were taught of different shortcut keys we can use when using PowerPoint, managing a slide and master slide, the use of different toolbars, and formatting 
            a presentation file. Creating a Webpage was our Last topic which is the hardest topic for me but the exciting topic also. We were taught the different foundations of web development and make our 
            own webpage.

                Participating in this program is a big opportunity for us Implementers, equipped with knowledge about technologies can help us in saving time and can be more productive in our work. I may know
            some of the functions of a computer, but then during our training I gained more knowledge, now i can create a presentable presentation, with transitions and animations, i know now how to use keyboard 
            shortcuts. I am lucky to be one of the CAIs to participate in this program.
